The dimensions for the different stats are different.

```{r warning=FALSE}
#If we are missing exactly one date value, then we only want the first term where the date values between the two data-sets are not equal to 0.
which(temp$game_date-temp2$game_date != 0)[1]

temp$game_date[142]

temp2$game_date[142]

Judge1 %>%
  filter(game_date=="2024-09-12")
```

On the September 12th game, Aaron Judge managed to get 1-4 (successful hits-appearances) with no balls called within 5 pitches.
